                    <p>My general approach to most tasks is to narrow down on what's required and put that down on a todo/checklist. This project was a little tricky because it forced us to be a little creative with little to take in as requirements. I had to rely on my own intuition to think about what to include and if those things would provide a good opportunity to show off some of the things I learned.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As I mentioned in my <a href="./what-went-well.html">'What went well?'</a> post I was able to convert the Canvas module into a basis for the content of the website. This in turn allowed me to create another list summarising some of what I wanted to include in the website, from code to thematic styling. Evident in the use of ffxiv resource files.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>From here on I jumped into the code. My process for web development is to attack things in chunks, then within the chunks there are sub chunks. I begin with what's needed first i.e. pages, files, I also include fonts because I feel fonts from the get go already sets the vibe of a page, then I sit down and write up the HTML, creating the files and linking it in the HTML. I then whip out some html tags to visualise the blocks and content, further styling them with CSS jumping back and forth with page refreshes to see what's been effected.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ideally, I visualise in my head what I want the CSS code to do. This helps to reduce the time taken to switch from text editor to browser window and when something does need tweaking I can go back and forth to check the fixes. Once I'm happy with this chunk of work, I'll organise the CSS styling into comments and switch the lines of properties to either sequentially or categorically make sense. i.e. height & width together, properties effecting text style together, padding next to margin, border with background whatever xD</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Of course I'm just as lazy as the next person so I'll only do this with selectors with a lot of changes to its properties. It also reaaaalllyyy helps to know as many keyboard shortcuts as you can. Visual studio code has a few worth noting, alt + up/down brings code lines up or down, ctrl + / comments out a line in whatever language. Even with autocompletion it can be fickle exiting the block so you can code the next thing. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This can happen when adding attributes to html tags, you would type in the value and press enter thinking it would lock in the value but no! This would create a new line breaking the tag. Pressing Tab is the way to go then you can go on your way to close the block, you can also press ctrl + enter in any point in a line to push a new line down. Helpful when you had to edit a value but hitting enter from the blinker position would break the tag.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In summary my process goes from preparing/visualising, writing things down, HTML, CSS (in chunks). Oh I had forgotten to talk about the new thing I learned, Git. After these finishing these chunks and I'm happy with the progress I would jump onto my console and take a git status. Based on the changes, I would git add these modified/new files then git commit with a nice informative message about the changes that took place this time compared to the last commit. Lastly a git push transfers my commit to the remote repository updating the website on GitHub Pages.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>There's still plenty to smooth out and plenty new ways to learn how to do things. Needless to say I will be updating my workflow to be comfortable for me as well as efficient.</p>
