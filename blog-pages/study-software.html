                    <p>I chose to study software engineering because I have been heavily influenced by web sites and web development in general. I have worked on some websites for my family's business and being the only one who knew anything about making a website at the time I was forced to self study a lot. Over time the need for the website disappeared and I was left with a strong interest in properly understanding how the topic of my attention was used in the real world. Fast forward 5+ years I have found the time to pursue a formal education in the specialisation.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Further, I have always wanted to find an outlet for my creative side or the lack thereof. I enjoy the process of creating something from scratch then looking at it and appreciating where it started and what it took to get to the end result. I am not great at drawing and find the keyboard and mouse more effective tools, I still do dabble drawing doodles but I find the utility of a web application to be far more satisfying/useful that my own terrible doodles.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A lot of the choice to study engineering has to do with timing. Having done a computer science degree back in 2014 or whatever year it was and veering off the career path to pursue business has left me feeling unaccomplished. Not being able to fully utilise and/or expand on what I learned threw me for a loop, I fully expected that I would go into the tech industry. So in a sense there's a feeling that it was put on hold because the want to learn in this particular area of expertise is still very much there.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Over the years I tried to keep what I learned from fully disappearing but because the course in of itself was more of a discipline and not a speciality course I went from one project to the other sort of testing the waters. Web development was clearly the first path, I then went on to software development where I self taught myself how to create a desktop application with what I can only remember to be winforms? WPF? It was rough due to my inexperience in researching current/best practice software development.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I also looked into making mobile apps but that segue pushed me more into the game development direction. I proceeded to turn my passion for playing video games into making games. I discovered the various logistics involved in developing games as there are many components to publishing a half decent game. The main components being programming and art. The digital art or assets were the hardest to create myself but even the programming side was full of bumps, "Is this how it's done?" And "Why doesn't this work?"  Being frequent questions during my endeavours.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All in all my experiences have led me to pursue a more structured connected education where I can both refer to and learn with others that take an interest in programming. Two minds are better than one, especially true when one of the brains have done it before.</p>
