                    <p>This project has taught me to think about more than just how to program a webpage but also a lot about what should be involved/considered when preparing to program a webpage. If this was a product instead of a project then there would be more pressure on time constraints, as time  is usually inextricably linked with quality. Balancing both in a real world project would require all the skills of the programmer to be on point but on top of that getting the requirements from whoever wants the website designed is just as important.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Even with just myself playing both the role of programmer and designer I found that if I didn't know what I wanted in a design element it pushed back the development process further and further behind. Even in situations where I did know what I wanted design wise, I often didn't consider what kind of work it entailed. Case in point being the splash page that I created as sort of cover page for the website.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Despite the downsides there were uplifting revelations that came with the bad. Most surprisingly, I was able to navigate documentation to find topical information for the problems I encountered. In the past, I often searched hours for solutions sometimes ending with no solution at all. A big takeaway from this point of view is that it pays to have a reliable/official resource like documentation or reference to search through.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Of course there are some things that stood out when it came to programming the website. In the midst of coding from one thing to the next it quickly turned out that there were over 500+ lines of CSS, luckily for me, I decided to separate each section of CSS with comment headings. Comments are a great bit of utility for programmers to keep track of what each part of the code does without having to read each selector and then recognising which part of the HTML it effects.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Following on top of that approach, it pays to be able to categorise the different areas of styling that can be done on a webpage. For example you can have a section of CSS code dedicated to just text i.e. fonts used, font sizing, colours for headings, body, hyperlinks etc. As you work down from top to bottom of the HTML code adding in CSS, you can then apply overriding styles for specific text and put that code in it's own section marked 'Navigation' for example.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another key point is to not re-invent the wheel. When it came to styling certain elements, choosing colours or sourcing shapes/icons there are plenty of resources created by other people that help creating something of your own. cssgradient.io, loading.io/css, easesings.net just to name a few help with programmers/designers choose colours, graphics and animations without much need for ourselves to slug through the documentation to learn how to achieve an effect all on our own.</p>
