                  <p>This time around we learned about the React framework and how it can help us create Single Page Applications and use JSX syntax to build and customise our html and css without directly manipulating the DOM.</p>
                  <br />                                    
                  <p>React becomes an abstraction layer between the coder and DOM, allowing the coder to code almost entirely in Javascript.</p>
                  <p>The exception being JSX. JSX is essentially a Javascript form of HTML and is later transpiled, a fancy way of saying translate the code into HTML.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>Material UI takes this utility and provides coders with customisable prebuilt components styled with the 'Material' design.</p>
                  <p>Using these components it's very easy to use these prebuilt components to display data retrieved through React and Javascript.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>For my project I wanted to create an app to learn Hangul, the Korean character system / alphabet and what better way than to use flash cards? I took inspiration from the Anki program and tried to develop a per user experience.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                   <p>This project took a lot of effort, the base requirements were to use the create-react-app generator, to have ONE HTML page, use multiple components to keep your code organized, 3 routes, use react-router and proper RESTful routing, API data from public or hosted somewhere, persist data using a JSON server mock up backend and finally have some minimal styling.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>It then says to, "Go wild! These are only the basic requirements â€” you're free to add on as much stuff as you'd like." Well, in any case I just reaalllyyyy wanted to finish this App in a way that is functional and maybe a little useful.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>This week was also unfortunately rather busy for myself, which took away a lot of time I had from working on the project. But I was very keen about React and wanted to learn as much as I could to bring this app to fruition.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>I first wanted to learn how to use Material UI. There was also Bootstrap for React but I went with MUI because it was specifically built with React in mind if I remember correctly.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>I went through the documentation and a few examples on the website but I wasn't getting the bigger picture, "How do I use this component?" "How does this and that work together?" After an hour or two I decided, nope, I need someone to explain this to me. </p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>Thank goodness for Youtube. I found a few 15-20min videos about Material UI and blasted through one trying to get that bigger picture of how the components are used taking them from the documentation to the code editor.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>With step 1 complete I could then work on the next meaty parts, JSON data, routing and in general... REACT.</p>
                  <p>Hooks, props, components EVERYWHERE! It soon became clear to me that while I could envision what it might look like, getting there was a whole other story!</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>The hardest and most mentally taxing part was deciding how to use the hangul list I found on zKorean.com in a way that tests the user and then shows the user their progress.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>This was a full blown project, but it really helped me put things into perspective. With my projects I want them to have meaning such that I can actually see the purpose and use of the things we learn in class and how it translates to the real world.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>Considering the projects are also something I can use in my portfolios I may as well go HARD and challenge myself. This will hopefully push myself to learn the skills and attitude to land my first job.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>Inevitably, there is only so much one can do in a week with other commitments. I had to write code that worked and it ended up being more verbose and less concise than what I wanted. I went through and explored different ways of achieving the same result, all for the purpose of practicing and understanding the best way to code something.</p>
                  <br />                                      
                  <p>In saying that, there may be some erroneous console logs and extra variables I used to help debug and break up the flow of data. All in all, I like to think this project is useful in some way and I hope you do too, thanks for reading!</p>
