                    <p>Developing this personal/showcase website left me in quite a tizzle. The feeling is very similar to writer's block of which I am very much a victim of at the best of times. What do I put in? How much do I put in? What should it look like? Sounding like writer's block yet?
                    <br>
                    <p>Well, just like writer's block the best way to get started is to just get started! So the first thing I did was to go through the motions of creating a website, html block, header block, body bing body bang and it was under way.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Reading over the assignment a few times again really helped to get my thoughts sorted out, as the contents of the website began to take shape in my mind's eye. What did you learn in the first 2 weeks of the course? The first time I read that I thought to myself "Damn my memory sucks." I was sure that I picked up quite a lot of tricks, especially in the git/cli area, but my timeline is all over the place. A website can't be super messy so I needed to find structure, I soon realised the best place to find structure of what I learned over the 2 weeks was straight from the course's Canvas dashboard!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I already had in mind that I wanted to showcase anchor tag navigation using the links in the navbar because I've always appreciated that feature, especially in reference websites. So I knew what I had to do and almost satisfyingly things started to fall into place. I was using what I learnt in my project! Semantic HTML tags were a new thing to me and it's use and purpose was not lost on me as the HTML file had far less divs than most other HTML files I'd created before.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>But more chronologically, once I figured out what the structure of the content would be in my website the more I felt I could stretch a little. I was able to see the path (but not the work, <a href="./improvements.html">a story for another time</a> xD) so I decided to really go ham with designing a few things I've not tried before. I've done a splash screen before during my software development days (bleugh) which I thought would be a cool wow factor. I also incorporated animations into a lot of elements of which I was able to pick up quickly due to having to animate sprites in the Unity game engine. (You can read more <a href="./study-software.html">about my background here!</a>)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I was enjoying putting the pieces together and seeing it come alive, overall the progress from zero to hero was overcome mostly due to the time I spent working on the project. "Huh?" I hear you say. "So all you needed was time?" Well yes and no. As we all know time is a precious thing, and working full-time one finds they have very little of it to go around. ESPECIALLY for the things they dislike. I could have spent a year on this website and not have finished it if I didn't find it interesting/fulfilling in some way.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Now I can say for certain that there were two things that went well with this project, the first being how satisfying it was to envision the content of the website from basic HTML to HTML with content, to content with Styling to Styling with theme (ffxiv!) The second thing that went well was how well I was taking it! I didn't consider this work at all and wanted to test myself with how far I can take my skills so far and it was well worth it! I can now see where my limits are and better yet where I can improve.</p>
